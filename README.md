# 15.C57_Bus_Optimization

Optimization project for No√© Bertramo and Gabriel Duguey

## Project Summary

This project focuses on optimizing bus routes and schedules to improve efficiency and reduce operational costs. The primary objective is to develop a model that minimizes travel time and fuel consumption while maximizing passenger satisfaction. The project involves data collection, analysis, and the application of optimization algorithms.

Key steps include:
1. **Data Collection**: Gathering data on current bus routes, schedules, passenger numbers, and travel times.
2. **Data Analysis**: Analyzing the collected data to identify patterns and areas for improvement.
3. **Model Development**: Creating an optimization model using techniques such as linear programming, integer programming, or metaheuristic algorithms.
4. **Implementation**: Applying the model to real-world scenarios and adjusting parameters to achieve optimal results.
5. **Evaluation**: Assessing the performance of the optimized routes and schedules through simulations and real-world trials.

The expected outcomes are reduced travel times, lower fuel consumption, and increased passenger satisfaction. The project also aims to provide a scalable solution that can be adapted to different cities and transportation networks.

Overall, this project combines theoretical knowledge with practical application to address a common urban transportation challenge.
